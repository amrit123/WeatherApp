## technology used
React at frontend because i have experience working with, redux for state management.(the app would work fine as of right now with out the redux state management, but if we expand the functionality, it will be hard to manage the state. so i used redux for manaing the state). npm for package  management. Scss as css pre processor. node js for using Npm.
